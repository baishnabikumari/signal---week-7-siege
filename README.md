# Catch The SIGNAL

**Catch The SIGNAL**is a high-speed reflex game, made on pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player is in charge of a small character that moves to the right and left to receive glowing signal waves on the screen. With every successful catch, the score goes up and the signal strength is preserved and missing waves diminishes the connection. Stepping out of the playable field activates a warning countdown, and the inability to be back on time leads to an explosion and termination of a game. The project has neon style interface, animation, background music and high score system to keep track of the progress and ya mine highscore is 1821 so ya beat me First!!!
